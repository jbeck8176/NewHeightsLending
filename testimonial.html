                        Joan is super knowledgeable, experienced and very responsive to both me and my Buyers. I work
                        24/7 at all hours of the day and night to get my Buyers into homes in this competitive market
                        and so does Joan! She has closed all of the loans she has done for my Buyers on time or early.
                        In addition, Joan is great at getting people ready to buy in the near future if they have any
                        issues that need to be addressed prior to obtaining a loan. Plus Joan is efficient and pleasant
                        to work with!

                        Omg!!! Lisa and Melissa.<br><br>

                        You ladies blew us away with the fast pace process in getting our home closed. We had a terrible
                        experience with a previous lender, We were hooked up with Lisa and Melissa and things changed
                        for the better. From the fast communication, to getting the loan cleared to closed within days,
                        you ladies exceeded our expectations in closing for our home. We can’t be more grateful for all
                        the hard work and even putting some of your own funding up to help us quicker to get our keys!
                        Thank you so much for everything! You were sent to us at the right time. God’s timing is perfect
                        and We are so very thankful!

                        Lisa and Melissa are wonderful! They helped my son purchase his first home. They are very
                        dedicated, willing to take phones calls any time of day, quick to respond to questions no matter
                        how silly they may seem, able to work their schedule around yours, and diligent about getting
                        you the best interest rate. Couldn’t have asked for more personal service. They were the
                        absolute best. I highly recommend for any loan need you may have!!!

                        AMAZING!! AMAZING!! My husband and I have bought a couple of houses in our day but have never
                        had such a positive experience. We had that experience because of Joan and her team. They hung
                        with us even when there was a couple of bumps in the road. Joan was reachable anytime we needed
                        her. I cannot say thank you enough to her!!! If you are looking for someone to help you get a
                        home loan go with Joan. She is wonderful!!

                        Emily worked so patiently and tirelessly with me so I was pre-qualified for my loan, since I was
                        selling my forever home in Reno to make the move to my new '"forever" in Sacramento. Having
                        Emily's loan made all the difference in the world to me because she made a loan available to buy
                        whatever home that I liked. When that home presented itself, the trustee accepted my offer
                        because they would receive my pay off the fastest...thanks to Emily.

                        She answered, it felt like, thousands of my questions with understandable answers, any time of
                        the day or evening, weekends , as well as, during her kids Spring Break.

                        At age 74, I don't intend to purchase another home but if I did...I would call Emily!

                        My wife and I tried to refinance our home which was liened by IRS and other Government agencies.
                        After trying with horrible credit and no success we took Emily's advice regarding credit clean
                        up. After approx. 1 year we returned to Emily and she helped us get not only a great loan but
                        cash out on top of it. We finally got our lives back and it was in part due to Emily's hard work
                        to help us. If you give Emily the chance and do what she says I guarantee you too will have a
                        great outcome. Thanks, Emily !!

                        We highly recommend this company. When previously attempting to refinance, it was such as
                        hassle, we gave up. Lisa was extremely helpful, kind, and honest. New Heights Lending made the
                        process extremely easy, stress free, and FAST! We appreciate how Lisa went out of her way to
                        make the process easier for us and worked hard to find us the right deal. Thank you!

                        Emily has been working with us from the beginning. From our first house to our most recent
                        refinance. Emily goes above and beyond in searching for the best rates and possibilities. She
                        makes sure that all requirements is met to insure a smooth transaction. Communication is
                        excellent. Our relationship with Emily feels almost as she is family. I will always deal with

                        I recommend Lucy Olcott at New Heights Lending she was very thorough in explaining all the
                        aspects of my new loan. Lucy was personable funny and made a usually stressful process for me
                        while not enjoyable very bearable. She is a knowledgeable and efficient loan officer I give 5
                        stars t o Lucy and New Heights Lending.

                            I just completed one of the most pleasant transactions that I've ever experienced in my entire life with New Heights Lending LLC. This team which included Robert and Lucy performed magic from introduction to closing. I was welcomed with open arms and am grateful for the confirmation of approval!  Throughout my life I have purchased many properties. I am not new to this game. I can honestly say, this team performed “above and beyond”. Their customized approach is commendable and unique. Both Robert and Lucy were customer orientated and held my hand through the process without any stress. Their kindness an acceptance of a customer in need will forever be remembered. I am a military veteran of 24 years active duty Air Force and 10 years Department of Defense. I have always held high standards and I was always required to perform with high standards. This team was meticulous in every step. Communication was valuable and they always kept the door open for any additional questions. These guys are the unsung heroes of the home-buying process. In my case it was a refinance. In my opinion just as crucial and important to me. None of this would've been possible without Robert and Lucy. It seems easy to forget who is behind the scenes when the customer is focused on just getting a loan. This is just a reminder to them that both of them are very important to me, not only my son, but to any other future customer that may happen upon New Heights Lending LLC. With all the competition out there, this was an easy choice. No regrets and I will recommend upon my rather large network of military and civilian friends to call up New Heights Lending LLC and see what they can do for you. One last THANK YOU Robert Hart Hartry and Lucy Olcott!
